# Dialogue

Max amount of chars is 3 as seen in [this screenshot](assets/images/reference%20images/overworld/dialogueRef.png)

Dialogue after you win (in most cases)

For certain words the character has a voice clip for it

# Overworld

The overworld sprites are utter dogshit as seen [here](assets/images/reference%20images/overworld/main.png) :sob:

OG Battle uses a mouse cursor type movement where Sonic follows it. (Might make it a selectable option, dunno though.)

Peak OST.

Uses a little circle thingy for interacting with a place as seen in [this screenshot](assets/images/reference%20images/overworld/main.png)

Uhh idk how to describe this but stuff around circle thingy and name of place that ur hovering over shows as seen in [this screenshot](assets/images/reference%20images/overworld/selectable.png)

Will have to interact with the said place again after a battle if you have to go there. (Interacting with Tails' workshop 3 times is annoying lol!)

Theres a party system (3 chars max)

# Battle (in-game)

Every character has a circle shadow underneath them

Every character has a unique voice clip for when the battle starts

Health Bar and uh Special (?) bar.

1 second delay after healing before you can attack and move again

Character starts flashing a bit after a while of healing (icon flashes too)

19 (or 18) second timer after you lose a stock/life

Said timer continues when spawning, also silly little spawn icon as seen in [this screenshot](assets/images/reference%20images/battle/respawning.png)

Character falls out of sky on the spot they picked and healthbar tweens back up to full health

Fade out when u win (or lose?)

Dialogue after you win (in most cases)

Sonic has an effect after using his thok (I didn't wanna call it a homing attack because it really isn't one.)

Possible chance of a voice clip playing when you take a stock from someone
